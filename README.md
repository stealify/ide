# @stealify/ide
All Kind of IDE Related Tooling and Stuff

## Goals
Replacing vscodium, codeserver, eclipse-che, theia 
With Stealify Implementations of that functionality.


## Moved
Calling it now editor moving the main effort into a own org called 
- https://github.com/unlicense-code/editor 
- [editor/installe](https://unlicense-code.github.io/editor/installer/)r to create your own builds.

## Experiment Conclusion
Maintainance of existing build structures creates Work N Potenzial N is to High. 
Solution is to finish the editor Implementation directly inside devtools that reduces
Maintainance Complexity by more then 100k Sloc No Joke including all dependencies 
to link into the existing implementation from electron it is far more then 100k sloc
